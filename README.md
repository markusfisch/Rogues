A multiplayer game for [Ludum Dare][ldjam] #40
"The more you have, the worse it is".

Find gold and try to leave the map with it.
Rob other players, but beware, the more gold you have,
the easier you can be robbed yourself and the slower you move.
Trees and stones give cover.

Play the improved post-compo version [here][post] or have a look at
the original [entry][entry].
